Gen: A General-Purpose Probabilistic Programming System with Programmable Inference

*Warning: This is rapidly evolving research software.*

See [https://gen.dev](https://gen.dev/) for introduction, documentation, and tutorials.

The Gen PLDI 2019 paper is publicly available [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3314642).

Gen was created at the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/). To get in contact with the Project, please fill out this [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbPY5e0KMVEFg7tjVUsOsKy5tWV9Moml3dPkDPXvP8-TSMNA/viewform?usp=sf_link). (But please don't hesitate to engage directly with the Gen open source project via the GitHub site!)
