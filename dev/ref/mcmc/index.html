The function that samples the new hypothesis given the previous hypothesis is called the <strong>MCMC kernel</strong> (or `kernel&#39; for short). If we design the kernel appropriately, then the distribution of the hypotheses will converge to the conditional (i.e. posterior) distribution as we increase the number of times we apply the kernel.</p><p>Gen includes primitives for constructing MCMC kernels and composing them into MCMC algorithms. Although Gen encourages you to write MCMC algorithms that converge to the conditional distribution, Gen does not enforce this requirement. You may use Gen&#39;s MCMC primitives in other ways, including for stochastic optimization.</p><p>For background on MCMC see [1].</p><p>[1] Andrieu, Christophe, et al. &quot;An introduction to MCMC for machine learning.&quot; Machine learning 50.1-2 (2003): 5-43. <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~arnaud/andrieu_defreitas_doucet_jordan_intromontecarlomachinelearning.pdf">Link</a>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="MCMC-in-Gen-1" href="#MCMC-in-Gen-1">MCMC in Gen</a></h2><p>Suppose we are doing inference in the following toy model:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">@gen function model()
    x = @trace(bernoulli(0.5), :x) # a latent variable
    @trace(normal(x ? -1. : 1., 1.), :y) # the variable that will be observed
end</code></pre><p>To do MCMC, we first need to obtain an initial trace of the model. Recall that a trace encodes both the observed data and hypothesized values of latent variables. We can obtain an initial trace that encodes the observed data, and contains a randomly initialized hypothesis, using <a href="../gfi/#Gen.generate"><code>generate</code></a>, e.g.:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">observations = choicemap((:y, 1.23))
trace, = generate(model, (), observations)</code></pre><p>Then, an MCMC algorithm is Gen is implemented simply by writing Julia <code>for</code> loop, which repeatedly applies a kernel, which is a regular Julia function:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">for i=1:100
    trace = kernel(trace)
end</code></pre><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Built-in-Stationary-Kernels-1" href="#Built-in-Stationary-Kernels-1">Built-in Stationary Kernels</a></h2><p>However, we don&#39;t expect to be able to use any function for <code>kernel</code> and expect to converge to the conditional distribution. To converge to the conditional distribution, the kernels must satisfy some properties. One of these properties is that the kernel is <strong>stationary</strong> with respect to the conditional distribution. Gen&#39;s inference library contains a number of functions for constructing stationary kernels:</p><ul><li><p><a href="#Gen.metropolis_hastings"><code>metropolis_hastings</code></a> with alias <a href="#Gen.mh"><code>mh</code></a>, which has three variants with differing tradeoffs between ease-of-use and efficiency. The simplest variant simply requires you to select the set of random choices to be updated, without specifying how. The middle variant allows you to use custom proposals that encode problem-specific heuristics, or custom proposals based on neural networks that are trained via amortized inference. The most sophisticated variant allows you to specify any kernel in the <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~mapjg/papers/RJMCMCBka.pdf">reversible jump MCMC</a> framework.</p></li><li><p><a href="#Gen.mala"><code>mala</code></a>, which performs a Metropolis Adjusted Langevin algorithm update on a set of selected random choices.</p></li><li><p><a href="#Gen.hmc"><code>hmc</code></a>, which performs a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo update on a set of selected random choices.</p></li><li><p><a href="#Gen.elliptical_slice"><code>elliptical_slice</code></a>, which performs an elliptical slice sampling update on a selected multivariate normal random choice.</p></li></ul><p>For example, here is an MCMC inference algorithm that uses <a href="#Gen.mh"><code>mh</code></a>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function do_inference(y, num_iters)

        trace, = mh(trace, select(:x))
        push!(xs, trace[:x])

    xs
end</code></pre><p>Note that each of the kernel functions listed above stationary with respect to the joint distribution on traces of the model, but may not be stationary with respect to the intended conditional distribution, which is determined by the set of addresses that consititute the observed data. If a kernel modifies the values of any of the observed data, then the kernel is not stationary with respect to the conditional distribution. Therefore, you should <strong>ensure that your MCMC kernels never propose to the addresses of the observations</strong>.</p><p>Note that stationarity with respect to the conditional distribution alone is not sufficient for a kernel to converge to the posterior with infinite iterations. Other requirements include that the chain is <strong>irreducible</strong> (it is possible to get from any state to any other state in a finite number of steps), and <strong>aperiodicity</strong>, which is a more complex requirement that is satisfied when kernels have some probability of staying in the same state, which most of the primitive kernels above satisfy. We refer interested readers to [1] for additional details on MCMC convergence.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Enabling-Dynamic-Checks-1" href="#Enabling-Dynamic-Checks-1">Enabling Dynamic Checks</a></h2><p>Gen does not statically guarantee that kernels (either ones built-in or composed with the <a href="#Composite-Kernel-DSL-1">Composite Kernel DSL</a>) are stationary. However, you can enable dynamic checks that will detect common bugs that break stationarity. To enable the dynamic checks we pass a keyword argument beyond those of the kernel itself:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">new_trace = k(trace, 2, check=true)</code></pre><p>Note that these checks aim to detect when a kernel is not stationary with respect to the model&#39;s <strong>joint</strong> distribution. To add an additional dynamic check for violation of stationarity with respect to the <em>conditional</em> distribution (conditioned on observations), we pass in an additional keyword argument containing a choice map with the observations:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">new_trace = k(traced, 2, check=true, observations=choicemap((:y, 1.2)))</code></pre><p>If <code>check</code> is set to <code>false</code>, then the observation check is not performed.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Composite-Kernel-DSL-1" href="#Composite-Kernel-DSL-1">Composite Kernel DSL</a></h2><p>You can freely compose the primitive kernels listed above into more complex kernels. Common types of composition including e.g. cycling through multiple kernels, randomly choosing a kernel to apply, and choosing which kernel to apply based on the current state. However, not all such compositions of stationary kernels will result in kernels that are themselves stationary.</p><p>Gen&#39;s <strong>Composite Kernel DSL</strong> is an embedded inference DSL that allows for more safe composition of MCMC kernels, by formalizing properties of the compositions that are sufficient for stationarity, encouraging compositions with these properties, and dynamically checking for violation of these properties. Although the DSL does not <em>guarantee</em> stationarity of the composite kernels, its dynamic checks do catch common cases of non-stationary kernels. The dynamic checks can be enabled and disabled as needed (e.g. enabled during testing and prototyping and disabled during deployment for higher performance).</p><p>The DSL consists of a macro – <a href="#Gen.@kern"><code>@kern</code></a> for composing stationary kernels from primitive stationary kernels and composite stationary kernels, and two additional macros: –- <a href="#Gen.@pkern"><code>@pkern</code></a> for declaring Julia functions to be custom primitive stationary kernels, and <a href="#Gen.@rkern"><code>@rkern</code></a> for declaring the reversal of a custom primitive kernel (these two macros are advanced features not necessary for standard MCMC algorithms).</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Composing-Stationary-Kernels-1" href="#Composing-Stationary-Kernels-1">Composing Stationary Kernels</a></h3><p>The <a href="#Gen.@kern"><code>@kern</code></a> macro defines a composite MCMC kernel in a restricted DSL that is based on Julia&#39;s own function definition syntax.</p><p>Suppose we are doing inference in the following model:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">@gen function model()

end</code></pre><p>In the DSL, the first argument (<code>trace</code> in this case) represents the trace on which the kernel is acting. the kernel may have additional arguments. The code inside the body can read from the trace (e.g. <code>trace[:n]</code> reads the value of the random choice <code>:n</code>). Finally, the return value of the composite kernel is automatically set to the trace. NOTE: It is not permitted to assign to the trace variable, except with <code>~</code> expressions. Also note that stationary kernels, when treated as Julia functions, return a tuple, where the first element is the trace and the remaining arguments are metadata. When applying these kernels with <code>~</code> syntax within the DSL, it is not necessary to unpack the tuple (the metadata is ignored automatically).</p><p>The language constructs supported by this DSL are:</p><p><strong>Applying a stationary kernel.</strong> To apply a kernel, the syntax <code>trace ~ k(trace, args..)</code> is used. Note that the <code>check</code> and <code>observations</code> keyword arguments (see <a href="#Enabling-Dynamic-Checks-1">Enabling Dynamic Checks</a>) should not be used here; they will be added automatically.</p><p><strong>For loops.</strong> The range of the for loop may be a deterministic function of the trace (as in <code>trace[:n]</code> above). The range must be <em>invariant</em> under all possible executions of the body of the for loop. For example, the random walk based kernel embedded in the for loop in our example above cannot modify the value of the random choice <code>:n</code> in the trace.</p><p><strong>If-end expressions</strong> The predicate condition may be a deterministic function of the trace, but it also must be invariant (i.e. remain true) under all possible executions of the body.</p><p><strong>Deterministic let expressions.</strong> We can use <code>let x = value .. end</code> to bind values to a variable, but the expression on the right-hand-side must be deterministic function of its free variables, its value must be invariant under all possible executions of the body.</p><p><strong>Stochastic let expressions.</strong> We can use <code>let x ~ dist(args...) .. end</code> to sample a stochastic value and bind to a variable, but the expression on the right-hand-side must be the application of a Gen <a href="ref/@ref"><code>Distribution</code></a> to arguments, and the distribution and its arguments must be invariant under all possible executions of the body.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Declaring-primitive-kernels-for-use-in-composite-kernels-1" href="#Declaring-primitive-kernels-for-use-in-composite-kernels-1">Declaring primitive kernels for use in composite kernels</a></h3><p>Note that all calls to built-in kernels like <a href="#Gen.mh"><code>mh</code></a> should be stationary, but that users are also free to declare their own arbitrary code as stationary. The <a href="#Gen.@pkern"><code>@pkern</code></a> macro declares a Julia function as a stationary MCMC kernel, for use with the MCMC Kernel DSL.

Involution MCMC allows you to express a broad class of custom MCMC kernels that are not expressible using the other, simpler variants of Metropolis-Hastings supported by Gen. These kernels are particularly useful for inferring the structure (e.g. control flow) of a model.</p><p>[2] Green, Peter J. &quot;Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo computation and Bayesian model determination.&quot; Biometrika 82.4 (1995): 711-732. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/82/4/711/252058">Link</a></p><p>An involutive MCMC kernel in Gen takes as input a previous trace of the model (whose choice map we will denote by <span>$t$</span>), and performs three phases to obtain a new trace of the model:</p><ul><li><p>First, it traces the execution of a <strong>proposal</strong>, which is an auxiliary generative function that takes the previous trace of the model as its first argument. Mathematically, we will denote the choice map associated with the trace of the proposal by <span>$u$</span>. The proposal can of course be defined using the <a href="ref/@ref">Built-In Modeling Languages</a>, just like the model itself.

The defining property of the involution is that <em>it is invertible</em>, and <em>it is its own inverse</em>; i.e. <span>$(t, u) = h(h(t, u))$</span>. Intuitively, <span>$u&#39;$</span> is a description of a way that the proposal could be reversed, taking <span>$t&#39;$</span> to <span>$t$</span>.</p></li><li><p>Finally, it computes an acceptance probability, which involves computing certain derivatives associated with the involution, and stochastically accepts or rejects the proposed model trace according to this probability. The involution is typically defined using the <a href="../trace_translators/#Trace-Transform-DSL-1">Trace Transform DSL</a>, in which case the acceptance probability calculation is fully automated.</p></li></ul><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Example-1" href="#Example-1">Example</a></h3><p>Consider the following generative model of two pieces of observed data, at addresses <code>:y1</code> and <code>:y2</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">@gen function model()

    {:y2} ~ normal(m2, 0.1)
end</code></pre><p>Because this model has stochastic control flow, it represents two distinct structural hypotheses about how the observed data could have been generated: If <code>:z</code> is <code>true</code> then we enter the first branch, and we hypothesize that the two data points were generated from separate means, sampled at addresses <code>:m1</code> and <code>:m2</code>. If <code>:z</code> is <code>false</code> then we enter the second branch, and we hypohesize that there is a single mean that explains both data points, sampled at address <code>:m</code>.</p><p>We want to construct an MCMC kernel that is able to transition between these two distinct structural hypotheses. We could construct such a kernel with the simpler &#39;selection&#39; variant of Metropolis-Hastings, by selecting the address <code>:z</code>, e.g.:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">select_mh_structure_kernel(trace) = mh(trace, select(:z))[1]</code></pre><p>Sometimes, this kernel would propose to change the value of <code>:z</code>. We could interleave this kernel with another kernel that does inference over the mean random choices, without changing the structure, e.g.:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">@gen function fixed_structure_proposal(trace)
    if trace[:z]
        {:m1} ~ normal(trace[:m1], 0.1)
        {:m2} ~ normal(trace[:m2], 0.1)

fixed_structure_kernel(trace) = mh(trace, fixed_structure_proposal, ())[1]</code></pre><p>Combining these together, and applying to particular data and with a specific initial hypotheses:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">(y1, y2) = (1.0, 1.3)

for iter=1:100
    trace = select_mh_structure_kernel(trace)
    trace = fixed_structure_kernel(trace)
end</code></pre><p>However, this algorithm will not be very efficient, because the internal proposal used by the selection variant of MH is not specialized to the model. In particular, when switching from the model with a single mean to the model with two means, the values of the new addresses <code>:m1</code> and <code>:m2</code> will be proposed from the prior distribution. This is wasteful, since if we have inferred an accurate value for <code>:m</code>, we expect the values for <code>:m1</code> and <code>:m2</code> to be near this value. The same is true when proposing a structure change in the opposite direction. That means it will take many more steps to get an accurate estimate of the posterior probability distribution on the two structures.</p><p>We would like to use inferred values for <code>:m1</code> and <code>:m2</code> to inform our proposal for the value of <code>:m</code>. For example, we could take the geometric mean:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">m = sqrt(m1 * m2)</code></pre><p>However, there are many combinations of <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code> that have the same geometric mean. In other words, the geometric mean is not <em>invertible</em>. However, if we return the additional degree of freedom alongside the geometric mean (<code>dof</code>), then we do have an invertible function:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function merge_means(m1, m2)
    m = sqrt(m1 * m2)
    dof = m1 / (m1 + m2)
    (m, dof)
end</code></pre><p>The inverse function is:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function split_mean(m, dof)
    m1 = m * sqrt((dof / (1 - dof)))
    m2 = m * sqrt(((1 - dof) / dof))
    (m1, m2)
end</code></pre><p>We use these two functions to construct an involution, and we use this involution with <a href="#Gen.metropolis_hastings"><code>metropolis_hastings</code></a> to construct an MCMC kernel that we call a &#39;split/merge&#39; kernel, because it either splits a parameter value, or merges two parameter values. The proposal is responsible for generating the extra degree of freedom when splitting:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">@gen function split_merge_proposal(trace)
    if trace[:z]
        # currently two segments, switch to one
    else
        # currently one segment, switch to two
        {:dof} ~ uniform_continuous(0, 1)

The split-merge kernel gives a much more efficient inference algorithm for estimating the posterior probability on the two structures.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Reverse-Kernels-1" href="#Reverse-Kernels-1">Reverse Kernels</a></h2><p>The <strong>reversal</strong> of a stationary MCMC kernel with distribution <span>$k_1(t&#39;; t)$</span>, for model with distribution <span>$p(t; x)$</span>, is another MCMC kernel with distribution:</p><div>\[k_2(t; t&#39;) := \frac{p(t; x)}{p(t&#39;; x)} k_1(t&#39;; t)\]</div><p>For custom primitive kernels declared with <a href="#Gen.@pkern"><code>@pkern</code></a>, users can declare the reversal kernel with the <a href="#Gen.@rkern"><code>@rkern</code></a> macro:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">@rkern k1 : k2</code></pre><p>This also assigns <code>k1</code> as the reversal of <code>k2</code>.
