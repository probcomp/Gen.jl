# Probability Distributions

Gen provides a library of built-in probability distributions, and three ways of
defining custom distributions, each of which are explained below:

1. The [`@dist` constructor](@ref dist_dsl), for a distribution that can be expressed as a
   simple deterministic transformation (technically, a
   [pushforward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure)) of an
   existing distribution.

2. The [`HeterogeneousMixture`](@ref) and [`HomogeneousMixture`](@ref) constructors
   for distributions that are mixtures of other distributions.

3. An API for defining arbitrary [custom distributions](@ref
   custom_distributions) in plain Julia code.

## [Defining New Distributions Inline with the `@dist` DSL](@id dist_dsl)

The `@dist` DSL allows the user to concisely define a distribution, as long as
that distribution can be expressed as a certain type of deterministic
transformation of an existing distribution.  The syntax of the `@dist` DSL, as
well as the class of permitted deterministic transformations, are explained
below.

```julia
@dist name(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) = body
```
or
```julia
@dist function name(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)
    body
end
```

Here `body` is ordinary Julia code, with the constraint that `body` must
contain exactly one random choice.  The value of the `@dist` expression is then
a `Gen.Distribution` object called `name`, parameterized by `arg1, ..., argN`,
representing the distribution over _return values_ of `body`.

This DSL is designed to address the issue that sometimes, values stored in the
trace do not correspond to the most natural physical elements of the model
state space, making inference programming and querying more taxing than
necessary. For example, suppose we have a model of classes at a school, where
the number of students is random, with mean 10, but always at least 3. Rather
than writing the model as

```julia
@gen function class_model()
   n_students = @trace(poisson(7), :n_students_minus_3) + 3
   ...
end
```

and thinking about the random variable `:n_students_minus_3`, you can use the
`@dist` DSL to instead write

```julia
@dist student_distr(mean, min) = poisson(mean-min) + min

@gen function class_model()
   n_students = @trace(student_distr(10, 3), :n_students)
   ...
end
```

and think about the more natural random variable `:n_students`.  This leads to
more natural inference programs, which can constrain and propose directly to
the `:n_students` trace address.

### Permitted constructs for the body of a `@dist`

It is not possible for `@dist` to work on any arbitrary `body`.  We
now describe which constructs are permitted inside the `body` of a `@dist`
expression.

We can think of the `body` of an `@dist` function as containing ordinary Julia
code, except that in addition to being described by their ordinary Julia types,
each expression also belongs to one of three "type spaces." These are:

1. `CONST`: Constants, whose value is known at the time this `@dist` expression
   is evaluated.
2. `ARG`: Arguments and (deterministic, differentiable) functions of arguments.
   All expressions representing non-random values that depend on distribution
   arguments are `ARG` expressions.
3. `RND`: Random variables. All expressions whose runtime values may differ
   across multiple calls to this distribution (with the same arguments) are
   `RND` expressions.

**Importantly, Julia control flow constructs generally expect `CONST` values:
the condition of an `if` or the range of a `for` loop cannot be `ARG` or
`RND`.**

The body expression as a whole must be a `RND` expression, representing a
random variable. The behavior of the `@dist` definition is then to define a new
distribution (with name `name`) that samples and evaluates the logpdf of the
random variable represented by the `body` expression.

Expressions are typed compositionally, with the following typing rules:

1. **Literals and free variables are `CONST`s.** Literals and symbols that
   appear free in the `@dist` body are of type `CONST`.

2. **Arguments are `ARG`s.** Symbols bound as arguments in the `@dist`
   declaration have type `ARG` in its body.

3. **Drawing from a distribution gives `RND`.** If `d` is a distribution, and
   `x_i` are of type `ARG` or `CONST`, `d(x_1, x_2, ...)` is of type `RND`.

4. **Functions of `CONST`s are `CONST`s.** If `f` is a deterministic function
   and `x_i` are all of type `CONST`, `f(x_1, x_2, ...)` is of type `CONST`.

5. **Functions of `CONST`s and `ARG`s are `ARG`s.** If `f` is a
   _differentiable_ function, and each `x_i` is either a `CONST` or a _scalar_
   `ARG` (with at least one `x_i` being an `ARG`), then `f(x_1, x_2, ...)` is
   of type `ARG`.

6. **Functions of `CONST`s, `ARG`s, and `RND`s are `RND`s.** If `f` is one of a
   special set of deterministic functions we've defined (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`,
   `exp`, `log`, `getindex`), and exactly one of its arguments `x_i` is of type
   `RND`, then `f(x_1, x_2, ...)` is of type `RND`.

One way to think about this, without all the rules, is that `CONST` values are
"contaminated" by interaction with `ARG` values (becoming `ARG`s themselves),
and both `CONST` and `ARG` are "contaminated" by interaction with `RND`.
Thinking of the body as an AST, the journey from leaf node to root node always
involves transitions in the direction of `CONST -> ARG -> RND`, never in
reverse.

#### Restrictions
Users may _not_ reassign to arguments (like `x` in the above example), and may
not apply functions with side effects. Names bound to expressions of type `RND`
must be used only once. e.g., `let x = normal(0, 1) in x + x` is not allowed.

#### Examples

Let's walk through some examples.

```julia
@dist f(x) = exp(normal(x, 1))
```

We can annotate with types:
```
1 :: CONST		  (by rule 1)
x :: ARG 		  (by rule 2)
normal(x, 1) :: RND 	  (by rule 3)
exp(normal(x, 1)) :: RND  (by rule 6)
```

Here's another:
```julia
@dist function labeled_cat(labels, probs)
	index = categorical(probs)
	labels[index]
end
```

And the types:
```
probs :: ARG 			(by rule 2)
categorical(probs) :: RND 	(by rule 3)
index :: RND 			(Julia assignment)
labels :: ARG 			(by rule 2)
labels[index] :: RND 		(by rule 6, f == getindex)
```

Note that `getindex` is designed to work on anything indexible, not just
vectors. So, for example, it also works with Dicts.

Another one (not as realistic, but it uses all the rules):

```julia
@dist function weird(x)
  log(normal(exp(x), exp(x))) + (x * (2 + 3))
end
```

And the types:

```
2, 3 :: CONST 						(by rule 1)
2 + 3 :: CONST 						(by rule 4)
x :: ARG 						(by rule 2)
x * (2 + 3) :: ARG 					(by rule 5)
exp(x) :: ARG 						(by rule 5)
normal(exp(x), exp(x)) :: RND 				(by rule 3)
log(normal(exp(x), exp(x))) :: RND 			(by rule 6)
log(normal(exp(x), exp(x))) + (x * (2 + 3)) :: RND 	(by rule 6)
```

## Mixture Distribution Constructors

There are two built-in constructors for defining mixture distributions:
```@docs
HomogeneousMixture
HeterogeneousMixture
```

## Defining New Distributions From Scratch

For distributions that cannot be expressed in the `@dist` DSL, users can define
a custom distribution by defining an (ordinary Julia) subtype of
`Gen.Distribution` and implementing the methods of the [Distribution API](@ref
custom_distributions).  This method requires more custom code than using the
`@dist` DSL, but also affords more flexibility: arbitrary user-defined logic
for sampling, PDF evaluation, etc.
