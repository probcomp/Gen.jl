# [Introduction to Modeling in Gen](@id introduction_to_modeling_in_gen)

Welcome! In this tutorial, you'll get your feet wet with Gen, a
multi-paradigm platform for probabilistic modeling and inference. By
"multi-paradigm," we mean that Gen supports many different approaches to
modeling and inference:

- Unsupervised learning and posterior inference in generative models using
  Monte Carlo,  variational, EM, and stochastic gradient techniques.

- Supervised learning of conditional inference models (e.g. supervised
  classification and regression).

- Hybrid approaches including amortized inference / inference compilation,
  variational autoencoders, and semi-supervised learning.

Don't worry if you haven't seen some of these approaches before. One goal of
these tutorials will be to introduce you to a subset of them,
from a unified probabilistic programming perspective.

#### In this Tutorial

Approaching a problem from a probabilistic perspective requires both *modeling*
and *inference*:

- **Modeling**: You first need to frame the problem — and any assumptions you
  bring to the table — as a probabilistic model. A huge variety of problems can
  be viewed from a modeling & inference lens, if you set them up properly. 
  **This tutorial is about how to think of problems in this light, and how to use Gen**
  **to formally specify your assumptions and the tasks you wish to solve.**
  
- **Inference**: You then need to do the hard part: inference, that is, 
  solving the problem. In this tutorial, we'll use a particularly simple 
  *generic* inference algorithm: importance sampling with the prior as our
  proposal distributions. With enough computation, the algorithm 
  can in theory solve any modeling and inference problem, but in practice, for most problems of
  interest, it is too slow to achieve accurate results in a reasonable amount of time. 
  **Future tutorials introduce some of Gen's programmable inference features**, 
  which let you tailor the inference algorithm for use with more complex models (Gen will still automate the math!).

Throughout this tutorial, we will emphasize key degrees of modeling flexibility
afforded by the probabilistic programming approach, for example:

- Using a stochastic branching and function abstraction to express
  uncertainty about which of multiple models is appropriate.

- Representing models with an unbounded number of parameters (a 'Bayesian
  non-parametric' model) using loops and recursion.

We'll also introduce a technique for validating a model and
inference algorithm by predicting new data from inferred parameters, and
comparing this data to the observed data set.

However, this tutorial does not exhaustively cover all features of Gen's modeling language. 
For example, Gen's modeling combinators and its static modeling language
enable improved performance, but are not covered here.

## Gen and Julia

Gen is a package for the Julia language. The package can be loaded with:

```@example modeling_tutorial
using Gen
```

Gen programs typically consist of a combination of (i) probabilistic models written in modeling languages and (ii) inference programs written in regular Julia code. Gen provides a built-in modeling language that is itself based on Julia.  This tutorial uses the [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) Julia package for plotting.

```@example modeling_tutorial
using Plots
```

## [Generative Functions](@id gfi_tutorial_section)

Probabilistic models are represented in Gen as *generative functions*.
Generative functions are used to represent a variety of different types of
probabilistic computations including generative models, inference models,
custom proposal distributions, and variational approximations (see the
[Gen documentation](../index.md) or the 
[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3314221.3314642)). In this
tutorial, we focus on implementing _generative models_. A generative model
represents a data-generating process; as such, it encodes any assumptions we
have about our data and our problem domain.

The simplest way to construct a generative function is by using the [built-in
modeling DSL](@ref dml). Generative
functions written in the built-in modeling DSL are based on Julia function
definition syntax, but are prefixed with the `@gen` macro:

```julia
@gen function function_name_here(input_arguments)
    # Function body...
end
```

The function represents the data-generating process we are modeling.
Conceptually, every time we run the function, it should generate a new
"synthetic dataset" in line with our assumptions. Along the way, it will make
random choices; each random choice it makes can be thought of as adding
a random variable to a probabilistic model.

Within the function body, most Julia code is permitted, but random choices use
special syntax that annotates them with an _address_:

```julia
{addr} ~ distribution(parameters)
```

A simple example of such an invocation is a normal distribution parametrized
with mean 0 and standard deviation 1:

```julia
my_variable = {:my_variable_address} ~ normal(0, 1)
```

Every random choice must be given an _address_, which can be
an arbitrary value—but we often use a symbol. 
(`:my_variable_address` is a symbol in the Julia language.)
Think of the address as the name of a particular random choice, which
is distinct from the name of the variable. For example, consider
the following code:

```julia
x = {:initial_x} ~ normal(0, 1)
if x < 0
    x = x + ({:addition_to_x} ~ normal(2, 1))
end
```

This code manipulates a single variable, `x`, but may make up to two random
choices: `:initial_x` and `:addition_to_x`.


Note that we can only use `~` to give addresses to _random choices_. 
The following will _not_ work because the code is trying to trace the
expression `sin(x)` which is an invocation of an ordinary Julia function, not
a distribution. 
```Julia
# INVALID:
my_variable = {:not_a_random_choice} ~ sin(x)
```
(We will see a bit later that it is _also_ possible to use `~`
to sample from helper _generative functions_, not just primitive 
distributions like `normal`. But for now, think of `~` as being
for making random choices.)

### Example 1: Linear regression

Suppose we have a dataset of points $(x, y)$ in the plane, and we'd like 
to infer a likely slope and intercept that explains their (linear) relationship.
To approach this problem from a probabilistic perspective, we first need to
develop a model. The model answers the question: how might this dataset have
come to be? It also encodes our assumptions, e.g., our assumption that our
data is explained by a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.

The generative function below represents a probabilistic model of a linear
relationship in the x-y plane. Given a set of $x$ coordinates, it randomly
chooses a line in the plane and generates corresponding $y$ coordinates so
that each $(x, y)$ is near the line. We might think of this function as
modeling house prices as a function of square footage, or the measured volume
of a gas as a function of its measured temperature.


```@example modeling_tutorial
@gen function line_model(xs::Vector{Float64})
    # We begin by sampling a slope and intercept for the line.
    # Before we have seen the data, we don't know the values of
    # these parameters, so we treat them as random choices. The
    # distributions they are drawn from represent our prior beliefs
    # about the parameters: in this case, that neither the slope nor the
    # intercept will be more than a couple points away from 0.
    slope = ({:slope} ~ normal(0, 1))
    intercept = ({:intercept} ~ normal(0, 2))
    
    # We define a function to compute y for a given x
    function y(x)
        return slope * x + intercept
    end

    # Given the slope and intercept, we can sample y coordinates
    # for each of the x coordinates in our input vector.
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        # Note that we name each random choice in this loop
        # slightly differently: the first time through,
        # the name (:y, 1) will be used, then (:y, 2) for
        # the second point, and so on.
        ({(:y, i)} ~ normal(y(x), 0.1))
    end

    # Most of the time, we don't care about the return
    # value of a model, only the random choices it makes.
    # It can sometimems be useful to return something
    # meaningful, however; here, we return the function `y`.
    return y
end
nothing # hide
```

The generative function takes as an argument a vector of x-coordinates. We create one below:


```@example modeling_tutorial
xs = [-5., -4., -3., -2., -1., 0., 1., 2., 3., 4., 5.]
nothing # hide
```

Given this vector, the generative function samples a random choice
representing the slope of a line from a normal distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 1, and a random choice representing the intercept of a
line from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 2. In
Bayesian statistics terms, these distributions are the *prior distributions*
of the slope and intercept respectively. Then, the function samples values
for the y-coordinates corresponding to each of the provided x-coordinates.

This generative function returns a function `y` encoding the slope
and intercept. 
We can run the model like we run a regular Julia function:

```@example modeling_tutorial
y = line_model(xs)
```

This gives us the return value of the model, but we
may be more interested in _the values of the random choices_ that
`line_model` makes. **Crucially, each random choice is annotated with a
unique *address*.** A random choice is assigned an address using the `{addr} ~ ...`
keyword. Addresses can be any Julia value. In this program, there are two
types of addresses used -- Julia symbols and tuples of symbols and integers.
Note that within the `for` loop, the same line of code is executed multiple
times, but each time, the random choice it makes is given a distinct address.

Although the random choices are not included in the return value, they *are*
included in the *execution trace* of the generative function. We can run the
generative function and obtain its trace using the [`simulate`](@ref) method
from the Gen API:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace = Gen.simulate(line_model, (xs,));
nothing # hide
```
This method takes the function to be executed, and a tuple of arguments to the function, and returns a trace and a second value that we will not be using in this tutorial. When we print the trace, we see that it is a complex data structure.

```@example modeling_tutorial
println(trace)
```

A trace of a generative function contains various information about an execution of the function. For example, it contains the arguments on which the function was run, which are available with the API method [`get_args`](@ref):

```@example modeling_tutorial
Gen.get_args(trace)
```

The trace also contains the value of the random choices, stored in a map from address to value called a *choice map*. This map is available through the API method [`get_choices`](@ref):

```@example modeling_tutorial
Gen.get_choices(trace)
```

We can pull out individual values from this map using Julia's subscripting syntax `[...]`:

```@example modeling_tutorial
choices = Gen.get_choices(trace)
choices[:slope]
```

We can also read the value of a random choice directly from the trace, without having to use [`get_choices`](@ref) first:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace[:slope]
```

The return value is also recorded in the trace, and is accessible with the [`get_retval`](@ref) API method:

```@example modeling_tutorial
Gen.get_retval(trace)
```

Or we can access the return value directly from the trace via the syntactic sugar `trace[]`:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace[]
```

In order to understand the probabilistic behavior of a generative function, it is helpful to be able to visualize its traces. Below, we define a function that uses PyPlot to render a trace of the generative function above. The rendering shows the x-y data points and the line that is represented by the slope and intercept choices.

```@example modeling_tutorial
function render_trace(trace; show_data=true)
    
    # Pull out xs from the trace
    xs, = get_args(trace)
    
    xmin = minimum(xs)
    xmax = maximum(xs)

    # Pull out the return value, useful for plotting
    y = get_retval(trace)
    
    # Draw the line
    test_xs = collect(range(-5, stop=5, length=1000))
    fig = plot(test_xs, map(y, test_xs), color="black", alpha=0.5, label=nothing,
                xlim=(xmin, xmax), ylim=(xmin, xmax))

    if show_data
        ys = [trace[(:y, i)] for i=1:length(xs)]
        
        # Plot the data set
        scatter!(xs, ys, c="black", label=nothing)
    end
    
    return fig
end
nothing # hide
```


```@example modeling_tutorial
render_trace(trace)
```

Because a generative function is stochastic, we need to visualize many runs in order to understand its behavior. The cell below renders a grid of traces.

```@example modeling_tutorial
function grid(renderer::Function, traces)
    Plots.plot(map(renderer, traces)...)
end
nothing # hide
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [Gen.simulate(line_model, (xs,)) for _=1:12]
grid(render_trace, traces)
```

-------------------------------------------------
### Exercise

Write a generative function that uses the same address twice. Run it to see what happens.

-------------------------------------------------
### Exercise

Write a model that generates a sine wave with random phase, period and
amplitude, and then generates y-coordinates from a given vector of
x-coordinates by adding noise to the value of the wave at each x-coordinate.
Use a  `gamma(1, 1)` prior distribution for the period, and a `gamma(1, 1)`
prior distribution on the amplitude (see
[`Gen.gamma`](@ref)).
Sampling from a Gamma distribution will ensure to give us postive real values.
Use a uniform distribution between 0 and $2\pi$ for the phase (see
[`Gen.uniform`](@ref)).

The sine wave should implement:

$ y(x) = a \sin(2\pi \frac{1}{p} x + \varphi)$,

where $a$ is the amplitude, $p$ is the period and $\varphi$ is the phase.  In
Julia the constant $\pi$ can be expressed as either `pi` or `π` (unicode).

When calling `trace = Gen.simulate(sine_model, (xs,))`, the following choices should appear:
- amplitude: `trace[:amplitude]`
- period: `trace[:period]`
- phase: `trace[:phase]`

We have provided some starter code for the sine wave model:

```julia
@gen function sine_model(xs::Vector{Float64})
    
    # < your code here, for sampling a phase, period, and amplitude >

    function y(x)
        return 1 # < Edit this line to compute y for a given x >
    end
    
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        {(:y, i)} ~ normal(y(x), 0.1)
    end
    
    return y # We return the y function so it can be used for plotting, below. 
end
```

```@raw html
<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
@gen function sine_model(xs)
    period = {:period} ~ gamma(1, 1)
    amplitude = {:amplitude} ~ gamma(1, 1)
    phase = {:phase} ~ uniform(0, 2*pi)

    # Define a deterministic sine wave with the values above
    function y(x)
        return amplitude * sin(x * (2 * pi / period) + phase)
    end

    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        {(:y, i)} ~ normal(y(x), 0.1)
    end

    return y
end
nothing # hide
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [Gen.simulate(sine_model, (xs,)) for _=1:12];
grid(render_trace, traces)
```

```@raw html
</details>
```

## Posterior Inference

Of course, we don't really care about generating lots of pictures of lines
(or sine waves). We'd really like to begin with an actual dataset of observed
$(x, y)$ points, and infer the corresponding slope and intercept (or phase,
period, and amplitude). This task is called _posterior inference_.

We now will provide a data set of y-coordinates and try to draw inferences
about the process that generated the data. We begin with the following data
set:

```@example modeling_tutorial
ys = [6.75003, 6.1568, 4.26414, 1.84894, 3.09686, 1.94026, 1.36411, -0.83959, -0.976, -1.93363, -2.91303];
nothing # hide
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
scatter(xs, ys, color="black", label=nothing, title="Observed data (linear)", xlabel="X", ylabel="Y")
nothing # hide
```

We will assume that the line model was responsible for generating the data,
and infer values of the slope and intercept that explain the data.

To do this, we write a simple *inference program* that takes the model we are
assuming generated our data, the data set, and the amount of computation to
perform, and returns a trace of the function that is approximately sampled
from the _posterior distribution_ on traces of the function, given the
observed data. That is, the inference program will try to find a trace that
well explains the dataset we created above. We can inspect that trace to find
estimates of the slope and intercept of a line that fits the data.

Functions like `importance_resampling` expect us to provide a _model_ and
also an _choice map_ representing our data set and relating it to the model.
A choice map maps random choice addresses from the model to values from our
data set. Here, we want to tie model addresses like `(:y, 4)` to data set
values like `ys[4]`:

```@example modeling_tutorial
function do_inference(model, xs, ys, amount_of_computation)
    
    # Create a choice map that maps model addresses (:y, i)
    # to observed values ys[i]. We leave :slope and :intercept
    # unconstrained, because we want them to be inferred.
    observations = Gen.choicemap()
    for (i, y) in enumerate(ys)
        observations[(:y, i)] = y
    end
    
    # Call importance_resampling to obtain a likely trace consistent
    # with our observations.
    (trace, _) = Gen.importance_resampling(model, (xs,), observations, amount_of_computation);
    return trace
end
nothing # hide
```

We can run the inference program to obtain a trace, and then visualize the result:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace = do_inference(line_model, xs, ys, 100)
render_trace(trace)
```

We see that `importance_resampling` found a reasonable slope and intercept to explain the data. We can also visualize many samples in a grid:

```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [do_inference(line_model, xs, ys, 100) for _=1:10];
grid(render_trace, traces)
```

We can see here that there is some uncertainty: with our limited data, we can't be 100% sure exactly where the line is. We can get a better sense for the variability in the posterior distribution by visualizing all the traces in one plot, rather than in a grid. Each trace is going to have the same observed data points, so we only plot those once, based on the values in the first trace:

```@example modeling_tutorial
function overlay(renderer, traces; same_data=true, args...)
    fig = renderer(traces[1], show_data=true, args...)
    
    xs, = get_args(traces[1])
    xmin = minimum(xs)
    xmax = maximum(xs)

    for i=2:length(traces)
        y = get_retval(traces[i])
        test_xs = collect(range(-5, stop=5, length=1000))
        fig = plot!(test_xs, map(y, test_xs), color="black", alpha=0.5, label=nothing,
                    xlim=(xmin, xmax), ylim=(xmin, xmax))
    end
    return fig
end
nothing # hide
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [do_inference(line_model, xs, ys, 100) for _=1:10];
overlay(render_trace, traces)
```

------------------

### Exercise

The results above were obtained for `amount_of_computation = 100`. Run the algorithm with this value set to `1`, `10`, and `1000`, etc.  Which value seems like a good tradeoff between accuracy and running time? Discuss.

------------------

### Exercise
Consider the following data set.

```@example modeling_tutorial
ys_sine = [2.89, 2.22, -0.612, -0.522, -2.65, -0.133, 2.70, 2.77, 0.425, -2.11, -2.76];
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
scatter(xs, ys_sine, color="black", label=nothing)
```

Write an inference program that generates traces of `sine_model` that explain this data set. Visualize the resulting distribution of traces. Temporarily change the prior distribution on the period to be `gamma(1, 1)`  (by changing and re-running the cell that defines `sine_model` from a previous exercise). Can you explain the difference in inference results when using `gamma(1, 1)` vs `gamma(5, 1)` prior on the period? How much computation did you need to get good results?

------------------

## Predicting new data

What if we'd want to predict `ys` given `xs`?

Using the API method [`generate`](@ref), we can generate a trace of a generative
function in which the values of certain random choices are constrained to given
values. The constraints are a choice map that maps the addresses of the
constrained random choices to their desired values.

For example:

```@example modeling_tutorial
constraints = Gen.choicemap()
constraints[:slope] = 0.
constraints[:intercept] = 0.
(trace, _) = Gen.generate(line_model, (xs,), constraints)
render_trace(trace)
```

Note that the random choices corresponding to the y-coordinates are still made randomly. Run the cell above a few times to verify this.

We will use the ability to run constrained executions of a generative
function to predict the value of the y-coordinates at new x-coordinates by
running new executions of the model generative function in which the random
choices corresponding to the parameters have been constrained to their
inferred values.  We have provided a function below (`predict_new_data`) that
takes a trace, and a vector of new x-coordinates, and returns a vector of
predicted y-coordinates corresponding to the x-coordinates in `new_xs`. We
have designed this function to work with multiple models, so the set of
parameter addresses is an argument (`param_addrs`):

```@example modeling_tutorial
function predict_new_data(model, trace, new_xs::Vector{Float64}, param_addrs)
    
    # Copy parameter values from the inferred trace (`trace`)
    # into a fresh set of constraints.
    constraints = Gen.choicemap()
    for addr in param_addrs
        constraints[addr] = trace[addr]
    end
    
    # Run the model with new x coordinates, and with parameters 
    # fixed to be the inferred values.
    (new_trace, _) = Gen.generate(model, (new_xs,), constraints)
    
    # Pull out the y-values and return them.
    ys = [new_trace[(:y, i)] for i=1:length(new_xs)]
    return ys
end
nothing # hide
```

To illustrate, we call the function above given the previous trace (which
constrained slope and intercept to be zero).

```@example modeling_tutorial
predict_new_data(line_model, trace, [1., 2., 3.], [:slope, :intercept])
```

The cell below defines a function that first performs inference on an
observed data set `(xs, ys)`, and then runs `predict_new_data` to generate
predicted y-coordinates. It repeats this process `num_traces` times, and
returns a vector of the resulting y-coordinate vectors.

```@example modeling_tutorial
function infer_and_predict(model, xs, ys, new_xs, param_addrs, num_traces, amount_of_computation)
    pred_ys = []
    for i=1:num_traces
        trace = do_inference(model, xs, ys, amount_of_computation)
        push!(pred_ys, predict_new_data(model, trace, new_xs, param_addrs))
    end
    pred_ys
end
nothing # hide
```

To illustrate, we generate predictions at `[1., 2., 3.]` given one (approximate) posterior
trace.

```@example modeling_tutorial
pred_ys = infer_and_predict(line_model, xs, ys, [1., 2., 3.], [:slope, :intercept], 1, 1000)
```

Finally, we define a cell that plots the observed data set `(xs, ys)` as red dots, and the predicted data as small black dots.

```@example modeling_tutorial
function plot_predictions(xs, ys, new_xs, pred_ys; title="predictions")
    fig = scatter(xs, ys, color="red", label="observed data", title=title)
    for (i, pred_ys_single) in enumerate(pred_ys)
        scatter!(new_xs, pred_ys_single, color="black", alpha=0.1, label=i == 1 ? "predictions" : nothing)
    end
    return fig
end
nothing # hide
```

Recall the original dataset for the line model. The x-coordinates span the interval -5 to 5.

```@example modeling_tutorial
scatter(xs, ys, color="red", label="observed data")
```

We will use the inferred values of the parameters to predict y-coordinates for x-coordinates in the interval 5 to 10 from which data was not observed. We will also predict new data within the interval -5 to 5, and we will compare this data to the original observed data. Predicting new data from inferred parameters, and comparing this new data to the observed data is the core idea behind *posterior predictive checking*. This tutorial does not intend to give a rigorous overview behind techniques for checking the quality of a model, but intends to give high-level intuition.


```@example modeling_tutorial
new_xs = collect(range(-5, stop=10, length=100));
nothing # hide
```

We generate and plot the predicted data:

```@example modeling_tutorial
pred_ys = infer_and_predict(line_model, xs, ys, new_xs, [:slope, :intercept], 20, 1000)
plot_predictions(xs, ys, new_xs, pred_ys)
```

The results look reasonable, both within the interval of observed data and in the extrapolated predictions on the right.

Now consider the same experiment run with the following data set, which has significantly more noise.

```@example modeling_tutorial
ys_noisy = [5.092, 4.781, 2.46815, 1.23047, 0.903318, 1.11819, 2.10808, 1.09198, 0.0203789, -2.05068, 2.66031];
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
pred_ys = infer_and_predict(line_model, xs, ys_noisy, new_xs, [:slope, :intercept], 20, 1000)
plot_predictions(xs, ys_noisy, new_xs, pred_ys)
```

It looks like the generated data is less noisy than the observed data in the regime where data was observed, and it looks like the forecasted data is too overconfident. This is a sign that our model is mis-specified. In our case, this is because we have assumed that the noise has value 0.1. However, the actual noise in the data appears to be much larger. We can correct this by making the noise a random choice as well and inferring its value along with the other parameters.

We first write a new version of the line model that samples a random choice for the noise from a `gamma(1, 1)` prior distribution.

```@example modeling_tutorial
@gen function line_model_fancy(xs::Vector{Float64})
    slope = ({:slope} ~ normal(0, 1))
    intercept = ({:intercept} ~ normal(0, 2))
    
    function y(x)
        return slope * x + intercept
    end
    
    noise = ({:noise} ~ gamma(1, 1))
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        {(:y, i)} ~ normal(slope * x + intercept, noise)
    end
    return y
end;
```

Then, we compare the predictions using inference of the unmodified and modified models on the `ys` data set:

```@example modeling_tutorial
pred_ys = infer_and_predict(line_model, xs, ys, new_xs, [:slope, :intercept], 20, 1000)
fixed_noise_plot = plot_predictions(xs, ys, new_xs, pred_ys; title="fixed noise")

pred_ys = infer_and_predict(line_model_fancy, xs, ys, new_xs, [:slope, :intercept, :noise], 20, 10000)
inferred_noise_plot = plot_predictions(xs, ys, new_xs, pred_ys; title="inferred noise")

plot(fixed_noise_plot, inferred_noise_plot)
```

Notice that there is more uncertainty in the predictions made using the modified model.

We also compare the predictions using inference of the unmodified and modified models on the `ys_noisy` data set:


```@example modeling_tutorial
pred_ys = infer_and_predict(line_model, xs, ys_noisy, new_xs, [:slope, :intercept], 20, 1000)
fixed_noise_plot = plot_predictions(xs, ys_noisy, new_xs, pred_ys; title="fixed noise")

pred_ys = infer_and_predict(line_model_fancy, xs, ys_noisy, new_xs, [:slope, :intercept, :noise], 20, 10000)
inferred_noise_plot = plot_predictions(xs, ys_noisy, new_xs, pred_ys; title="inferred noise")

plot(fixed_noise_plot, inferred_noise_plot)
```

Notice that while the unmodified model was very overconfident, the modified model has an appropriate level of uncertainty, while still capturing the general negative trend.

### Exercise

Write a modified version of the sine model that makes noise into a random choice. Compare the predicted data with the observed data using `infer_and_predict` and `plot_predictions` for the unmodified and modified models, and for the `ys_sine` and `ys_noisy` data sets. Discuss the results. Experiment with the amount of inference computation used. The amount of inference computation will need to be higher for the model with the noise as a random choice.

We have provided you with starter code:


```julia
@gen function sine_model_fancy(xs::Vector{Float64})

    # < your code here >

    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        {(:y, i)} ~ normal(0., 0.1) # < edit this line >
    end
    return nothing
end
```

    period = ({:period} ~ gamma(5, 1))
    amplitude = ({:amplitude} ~ gamma(1, 1))
    phase = ({:phase} ~ uniform(0, 2*pi))
    noise = ({:noise} ~ gamma(1, 1))

    function y(x)
        return amplitude * sin(x * (2 * pi / period) + phase)
    end

    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)

    end

    return y
end

# Modify the line below to experiment with the amount_of_computation parameter
pred_ys = infer_and_predict(sine_model_fancy, xs, ys_sine, new_xs, [], 20, 1)
inferred_noise_plot = plot_predictions(xs, ys_sine, new_xs, pred_ys; title="Inferred noise level")

## Calling other generative functions

In addition to making random choices, generative functions can invoke other
generative functions. To illustrate this, we will write a probabilistic model
that combines the line model and the sine model. This model is able to
explain data using either model, and which model is chosen will depend on the
data. This is called *model selection*.

A generative function can invoke another generative function in three ways:

- **(NOT RECOMMENDED)** using regular Julia function call syntax: `f(x)`

- using the `~` snytax with an address for the call: `{addr} ~ f(x)`

- using the `~` syntax with a wildcard address: `{*} ~ f(x)`

When invoking using regular function call syntax, the random choices made by
the callee function are not traced at all, and Gen cannot reason about them during inference. 
When invoking using `~` with a _wildcard_ address (`{*} ~ f(x)`), the random choices of the 
callee function are imported directly into the caller's trace. So, for example, if `f` makes a choice
called `:f_choice`, then the caller's trace will have a choice called `:f_choice` too. 
Note that a downside of this is that if `f` is called _twice_ by the same caller, then the two 
choices called `:f_choice` will clash, leading to an error.
In this case, it is best to provide an address (`{addr} ~ f(x)`): `f`'s random choices will
be placed under the _namespace_ `addr`. 


```@example modeling_tutorial
@gen function foo()
    {:y} ~ normal(0, 1)
end

@gen function bar()
    {:x} ~ bernoulli(0.5)
    # Call `foo` with a wildcard address.
    # Its choices (:y) will appear directly
    # within the trace of `bar`.
    {*} ~ foo()
end

@gen function bar_using_namespace()
    {:x} ~ bernoulli(0.5)
    # Call `foo` with the address `:z`.
    # The internal choice `:y` of `foo`
    # will appear in our trace at the
    # hierarchical address `:z => :y`.
    {:z} ~ foo()
end
nothing # hide
```

We first show the addresses sampled by `bar`:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace = Gen.simulate(bar, ())
Gen.get_choices(trace)
```

And the addresses sampled by `bar_using_namespace`:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace = Gen.simulate(bar_using_namespace, ())
Gen.get_choices(trace)
```

Using `{addr} ~ f()`, with a namespace, can help avoid address collisions for complex models.

A hierarchical address is represented as a Julia `Pair`, where the first element of the pair is the first element of the address and the second element of the pair is the rest of the address:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace[Pair(:z, :y)]
```

Julia uses the `=>` operator as a shorthand for the `Pair` constructor, so we can access choices at hierarchical addresses like:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace[:z => :y]
```

If we have a hierarchical address with more than two elements, we can construct the address by chaining the `=>` operator:

```@example modeling_tutorial
@gen function baz()
    {:a} ~ bar_using_namespace()
end

trace = simulate(baz, ())

trace[:a => :z => :y]
```

Note that the `=>` operator associated right, so this is equivalent to:

```@example modeling_tutorial
trace[Pair(:a, Pair(:z, :y))]
```

Now, we write a generative function that combines the line and sine models. It makes a Bernoulli random choice (e.g. a coin flip that returns true or false) that determines which of the two models will generate the data.

```@example modeling_tutorial
@gen function combined_model(xs::Vector{Float64})
    if ({:is_line} ~ bernoulli(0.5))
        # Call line_model_fancy on xs, and import
        # its random choices directly into our trace.
        return ({*} ~ line_model_fancy(xs))
    else
        # Call sine_model_fancy on xs, and import
        # its random choices directly into our trace
        return ({*} ~ sine_model_fancy(xs))
    end
end
nothing # hide
```

We visualize some traces, and see that sometimes it samples linear data and other times sinusoidal data.

```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [Gen.simulate(combined_model, (xs,)) for _=1:12];
grid(render_trace, traces)
```
    
We run inference using this combined model on the `ys` data set and the `ys_sine` data set. 

```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [do_inference(combined_model, xs, ys, 10000) for _=1:10];
linear_dataset_plot = overlay(render_trace, traces)
traces = [do_inference(combined_model, xs, ys_sine, 10000) for _=1:10];
sine_dataset_plot = overlay(render_trace, traces)
Plots.plot(linear_dataset_plot, sine_dataset_plot)
```

The results should show that the line model was inferred for the `ys` data set, and the sine wave model was inferred for the `ys_sine` data set.

-------

### Exercise

Construct a data set for which it is ambiguous whether the line or sine wave model is best. Visualize the inferred traces using `render_combined` to illustrate the ambiguity. Write a program that takes the data set and returns an estimate of the posterior probability that the data was generated by the sine wave model, and run it on your data set.

Hint: To estimate the posterior probability that the data was generated by the sine wave model, run the inference program many times to compute a large number of traces, and then compute the fraction of those traces in which `:is_line` is false.

-------

## Modeling with an unbounded number of parameters

Gen's built-in modeling language can be used to express models that use an
unbounded number of parameters. This section walks you through development of
a model of data that does not a-priori specify an upper bound on the
complexity of the model, but instead infers the complexity of the model as
well as the parameters. This is a simple example of a *Bayesian
nonparametric* model.

We will consider two data sets:

```@example modeling_tutorial
xs_dense = collect(range(-5, stop=5, length=50))
ys_simple = fill(1., length(xs_dense)) .+ randn(length(xs_dense)) * 0.1
ys_complex = [Int(floor(abs(x/3))) % 2 == 0 ? 2 : 0 for x in xs_dense] .+ randn(length(xs_dense)) * 0.1;
nothing # hide
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
simple_plot = scatter(xs_dense, ys_simple, color="black", label=nothing, title="ys-simple", ylim=(-1, 3))
complex_plot = scatter(xs_dense, ys_complex, color="black", label=nothing, title="ys-complex", ylim=(-1, 3))
Plots.plot(simple_plot, complex_plot)
```

The data set on the left appears to be best explained as a contant function
with some noise. The data set on the right appears to include two
changepoints, with a constant function in between the changepoints. We want a
model that does not a-priori choose the number of changepoints in the data.
To do this, we will recursively partition the interval into regions. We
define a Julia data structure that represents a binary tree of intervals;
each leaf node represents a region in which the function is constant.


```@example modeling_tutorial
struct Interval
    l::Float64
    u::Float64
end
nothing # hide
```


```@example modeling_tutorial
abstract type Node end
    
struct InternalNode <: Node
    left::Node
    right::Node
    interval::Interval
end

struct LeafNode <: Node
    value::Float64
    interval::Interval
end
nothing # hide
```

We now write a generative function that randomly creates such a tree. Note the use of recursion in this function to create arbitrarily large trees representing arbitrarily many changepoints. Also note that we assign the address namespaces `:left` and `:right` to the calls made for the two recursive calls to `generate_segments`.


```@example modeling_tutorial
@gen function generate_segments(l::Float64, u::Float64)
    interval = Interval(l, u)
    if ({:isleaf} ~ bernoulli(0.7))
        value = ({:value} ~ normal(0, 1))
        return LeafNode(value, interval)
    else
        frac = ({:frac} ~ beta(2, 2))
        mid  = l + (u - l) * frac
        # Call generate_segments recursively!
        # Because we will call it twice -- one for the left 
        # child and one for the right child -- we use
        # addresses to distinguish the calls.
        left = ({:left} ~ generate_segments(l, mid))
        right = ({:right} ~ generate_segments(mid, u))
        return InternalNode(left, right, interval)
    end
end
nothing # hide
```

We also define some helper functions to visualize traces of the `generate_segments` function.


```@example modeling_tutorial
function render_node!(node::LeafNode)
    plot!([node.interval.l, node.interval.u], [node.value, node.value], label=nothing, linewidth=5)
end

function render_node!(node::InternalNode)
    render_node!(node.left)
    render_node!(node.right)
end
nothing # hide
```

```@example modeling_tutorial
function render_segments_trace(trace; xlim=(0,1))
    node = get_retval(trace)
    fig = plot(xlim=xlim, ylim=(-3, 3))
    render_node!(node)
    return fig
end
nothing # hide
```

We generate 12 traces from this function and visualize them below. We plot the piecewise constant function that was sampled by each run of the generative function. Different constant segments are shown in different colors. Run the cell a few times to get a better sense of the distribution on functions that is represented by the generative function.


```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [Gen.simulate(generate_segments, (0., 1.)) for i=1:12]
grid(render_segments_trace, traces)
```

Because we only sub-divide an interval with 30% probability, most of these sampled traces have only one segment.

Now that we have a generative function that generates a random piecewise-constant function, we write a model that adds noise to the resulting constant functions to generate a data set of y-coordinates. The noise level will be a random choice.


```@example modeling_tutorial
# get_value_at searches a binary tree for
# the leaf node containing some value.
function get_value_at(x::Float64, node::LeafNode)
    @assert x >= node.interval.l && x <= node.interval.u
    return node.value
end

function get_value_at(x::Float64, node::InternalNode)
    @assert x >= node.interval.l && x <= node.interval.u
    if x <= node.left.interval.u
        get_value_at(x, node.left)
    else
        get_value_at(x, node.right)
    end
end

# Our full model
@gen function changepoint_model(xs::Vector{Float64})
    node = ({:tree} ~ generate_segments(minimum(xs), maximum(xs)))
    noise = ({:noise} ~ gamma(0.5, 0.5))
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        {(:y, i)} ~ normal(get_value_at(x, node), noise)
    end
    return node
end
nothing # hide
```

We write a visualization for `changepoint_model` below:

```@example modeling_tutorial
function render_changepoint_model_trace(trace; show_data=true)
    xs = Gen.get_args(trace)[1]
    node = Gen.get_retval(trace)
    fig = render_segments_trace(trace; xlim=(minimum(xs), maximum(xs)))
    render_node!(node)
    if show_data
        ys = [trace[(:y, i)] for i=1:length(xs)]
        scatter!(xs, ys, c="gray", label=nothing, alpha=0.3, markersize=3)
    end
end
nothing # hide
```

Finally, we generate some simulated data sets and visualize them on top of the underlying piecewise constant function from which they were generated:

```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [Gen.simulate(changepoint_model, (xs_dense,)) for i=1:12]
grid(render_changepoint_model_trace, traces)
```

Notice that the amount of variability around the piecewise constant mean function differs from trace to trace.

Now we perform inference for the simple data set:

```@example modeling_tutorial
traces = [do_inference(changepoint_model, xs_dense, ys_simple, 10000) for _=1:12];
grid(render_changepoint_model_trace, traces)
```

We see that we inferred that the mean function that explains the data is a constant with very high probability.

For inference about the complex data set, we use more computation. You can experiment with different amounts of computation to see how the quality of the inferences degrade with less computation. Note that we are using a very simple generic inference algorithm in this tutorial, which really isn't suited for this more complex task. In later tutorials, we will learn how to write more efficient algorithms, so that accurate results can be obtained with significantly less computation. We will also see ways of annotating the model for better performance, no matter the inference algorithm.

!!! warning
    The following cell may run for 2-3 minutes.

```julia
traces = [do_inference(changepoint_model, xs_dense, ys_complex, 100000) for _=1:12];
grid(render_changepoint_model_trace, traces)
```

The results show that more segments are inferred for the more complex data set.

------
### Exercise
Write a function that takes a data set of x- and y-coordinates and plots the histogram of the probability distribution on the number of changepoints.
Show the results for the `ys_simple` and `ys_complex` data sets.

Hint: The return value of `changepoint_model` is the tree of `Node` values. Walk this tree.

-------

### Exercise
Write a new version of `changepoint_model` that uses `{*} ~ ...` without an address to make the recursive calls.

Hint: You will need to guarantee that all addresses are unique. How can you label each node in a binary tree using an integer?
