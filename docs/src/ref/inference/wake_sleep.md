# Wake-Sleep Learning

Wake-sleep learning is algorithm that jointly learns a generative model, represented as a generative function `p` and an inference model, represented as an inference function `q`.

During the wake phase, `p` is trained on complete traces generated by running `q` on the observed data, which can be done using the [`train!](@ref) method. During the sleep phase, `q` is trained on data generated by simulating from `p`, which can be done using [`lecture!`](@ref) or [`lecture_batched!`](@ref):
