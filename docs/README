# Website Docs
- `pages.jl` to find skeleton of website.
- `make.jl` to build the website index.

# How to add tutorials
Currently you must write the tutorial directly in the docs rather than a source file (e.g. Quarto). See `getting_started` or `tutorials` for examples.

Code snippets must use the triple backtick with a label to run. The environment carries over so long as the labels match. Example:

```@example tutorial_1
x = rand()
```

```@example tutorial_1
print(x)
```
