### interface for to_array and fill_array ###

"""
    arr::Vector{T} = to_array(choices::ChoiceMap, ::Type{T}) where {T}

Populate an array with values of choices in the given assignment.

It is an error if each of the values cannot be coerced into a value of the
given type.

Implementation

The default implmentation of `fill_array` will populate the array by sorting
the addresses of the choicemap using the `sort` function, then iterating over
each submap in this order and filling the array for that submap.

To override the default implementation of `to_array`, 
a concrete subtype  `T <: ChoiceMap` should implement the following method:

    n::Int = _fill_array!(choices::T, arr::Vector{V}, start_idx::Int) where {V}

Populate `arr` with values from the given assignment, starting at `start_idx`,
and return the number of elements in `arr` that were populated.

(This is for performance; it is more efficient to fill in values in a preallocated array
by implementing `_fill_array!` than to construct discontiguous arrays for each submap and then merge them.)

"""
    choices::ChoiceMap = from_array(proto_choices::ChoiceMap, arr::Vector)

Return an assignment with the same address structure as a prototype
assignment, but with values read off from the given array.

It is an error if the number of choices in the prototype assignment
is not equal to the length the array.

The order in which addresses are populated with values from the array
should match the order in which the array is populated with values
in a call to `to_array(proto_choices, T)`.  By default,
this means sorting the top-level addresses for `proto_choices`
and then filling in the submaps depth-first in this order.

# Implementation

To support `from_array`, a concrete subtype `T <: ChoiceMap` must implement
the following method:

    (n::Int, choices::T) = _from_array(proto_choices::T, arr::Vector{V}, start_idx::Int) where {V}

Return an assignment with the same address structure as a prototype assignment,
but with values read off from `arr`, starting at position `start_idx`. Return the
number of elements read from `arr`.
